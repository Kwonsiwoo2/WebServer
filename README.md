## Prerequisites

1. **Server Environment**
   - PHP 7.0 or higher
   - MySQL 5.7 or higher
2. **Required Libraries**
   - Apache Web Server (or a similar web server)

---

## Installation and Execution

1. **Download the Source Code**
   Upload the project files to your web server.

2. **Database Configuration**
   - Create a database for the project in MySQL.
   - Modify the database connection details in `db_connect.php`:

   ```php
   <?php
   $db_host = "localhost";
   $db_user = "your_username";
   $db_pass = "your_password";
   $db_name = "your_database_name";

   $conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name);

   if ($conn->connect_error) {
       die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
   }
   ?>
   ```

3. **Set Up Database Tables**
   Execute the provided SQL script to create the necessary database tables.

4. **Run the Application**
   Open the project in a web browser by navigating to the root directory on your server.

## Usage

1. Users can sign up for an account and log in to access the application.
2. Logged-in users can view notices or manage notices (add or delete) if they have the necessary permissions.

---

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that the database credentials in `db_connect.php` are kept secure and not exposed.
- Passwords should be securely hashed before being stored in the database (e.g., using the `password_hash` function).

---

## Development Environment

- **Programming Language**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Web Server**: Apache

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Security**: Implement CSRF protection and improve password hashing mechanisms.
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Allow different levels of access based on user roles (e.g., Admin, User).
3. **Responsive Design**: Improve the front-end for better compatibility with mobile devices.
4. **Notification System**: Add an email or real-time notification system for critical updates.
